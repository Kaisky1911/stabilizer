///! System timer used for RTIC scheduling
///!
///! # Design
///! The SystemTimer is an RTIC monotonic timer that can be used for scheduling tasks in RTIC.
///! This timer is used in place of the cycle counter to allow the timer to tick at a slower rate
///! than the CPU clock. This allows for longer scheduling periods with less resolution. This is
///! needed for infrequent (e.g. multiple second) telemetry periods.

/// This implementation synchronizes access to the timer peripheral, so it is safe to copy/clone
/// and/or instantiate multiple timers. All timers will reference the same underlying hardware

/// wrap and behave incorrectly.
