# Stabilizer Firmware

## Hardware

[![Hardware](https://github.com/sinara-hw/Stabilizer/wiki/Stabilizer_v1.0_top_small.jpg)](https://github.com/sinara-hw/Stabilizer)

## Applications

This firmware offers a library of hardware and software functionality targeting the use of the Stabilizer hardware in various digital signal processing applications commonly occurring in Quantum Technology.
It provides abstractions over the fast analog inputs and outputs, time stamping, Pounder DDS interfaces and a collection of tailored and optimized digital signal processing algorithms (IIR, FIR, Lockin, PLL, reciprocal PLL, Unwrapper, Lowpass, Cosine-Sine, Atan2).
An application can compose and configure these hardware and software components to implement different use cases.

Check out the [Documentation](https://quartiq.de/stabilizer) for more information on usage.
